For simple slab models *refnx* offers either a simple *Jupyter* graphical user
interface (GUI), or a more sophisticated *PyQt* interface. To use the latter
from a console one needs to have the *pyqt5, periodictable, matplotib* packages
installed. The PyQt interface is still in alpha development. To start the gui
from the interpreter:

    ::

     >>> from refnx.reflect import gui
     >>> gui()

There are tutorials on how to use the PyQt interface on `YouTube`_. Suggestions
for more tutorials are welcomed.
